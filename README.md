# Who's That Spectrobe?

> See https://asith.itch.io/whos-that-spectrobe if you just want to play the game.

A browser-based game in which Spectrobe silhouettes are shown to the user and they guess which Spectrobe it is.

* Silhouettes are generated dynamically in-browser using the canvas tag
* Multiple difficulty settings, which choose the image source for generating the silhouette
* User-facing stats including correct streaks and times taken

## Development
### (For programmers; not important if you just want to play the game. See link above to play.)

You will need [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) set up to get the code running locally.

Once you have done this, install the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

To run the site locally, you can then run:

```
npm run serve
```

To build the site to be deployed online, run:

```
npm run build
```
